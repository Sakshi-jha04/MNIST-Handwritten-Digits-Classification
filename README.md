# MNIST-Handwritten-Digits-Classification
I crafted a handwritten digit classification model from scratch using Python and core libraries like NumPy, Pandas,
and Matplotlib. Delving deep into neural network fundamentals, I designed the architecture, implemented forward and backward propagation, 
and trained the model on datasets like MNIST. Evaluation involved meticulous analysis of metrics such as accuracy and visualization of 
training curves. This hands-on endeavor honed my understanding of neural networks, enhancing problem-solving skills and critical thinking 
in machine learning.
